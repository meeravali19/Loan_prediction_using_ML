# Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the approval status of loan applications using machine learning techniques.  
By analyzing applicant data, the model assists financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## 📂 Project Structure
**loan prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
**loan.csv:** Dataset used for training and testing the model.​

## 📊 Dataset Overview
### The dataset includes various features such as:  
**ApplicantIncome:** Income of the applicant.  
**CoapplicantIncome:** Income of the co-applicant.   
**LoanAmount:** Loan amount requested.  
**Loan_Amount_Term:** Term of the loan in months.  
**Credit_History:** Credit history meets guidelines.  
**Demographic information:** Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area  
**Loan_Status:** Target variable indicating loan approval status.​

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
**Ensure you have the following installed:​**  
Python 3.x  
Jupyter Notebook  
**Required Python libraries:**  
**🐼 pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
**🔢 numpy** – Numerical operations  
**🤖 scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms  
**📊 matplotlib** – Data visualization  
**🌊 seaborn** – Statistical data visualization  

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:​**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/meeravali19/Loan_prediction_using_ML.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:​**
   ```sh
